"""Jev (TypeSafe) method advisor: typed, calibrated proposals for modeling
decisions, logged as ADVISORY entries in the decision trace.

Boundary (see SKILL.md core framework 9): Jev proposes; a human decides. It
never computes statistics, never replaces bootstrap intervals or tests, and
never autonomously sets a threshold that determines a scientific result.

Privacy: only aggregate analysis metadata crosses the API boundary — sample
sizes, event counts, variable types, missingness rates. An allowlist guard
rejects anything resembling patient-level data. The API key is read from the
TYPESAFE_API_KEY environment variable and is never logged or written anywhere.

Offline behavior: with no key set or on API failure, a deterministic
rule-based advisor (EPV rule, n-based design choice) returns the same typed
structure with source="rule_based", so the skill works fully offline.
