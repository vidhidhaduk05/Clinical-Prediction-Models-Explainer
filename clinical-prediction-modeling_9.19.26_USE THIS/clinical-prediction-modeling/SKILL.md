description: "Methodology and code skill for developing, validating, and reporting clinical prediction models in Python. Covers missing data, restricted cubic splines, logistic/survival/continuous outcomes, penalization, bootstrap and out-of-bag validation, calibration, decision curves, ML benchmarking, interpretability, and TRIPOD+AI reporting. Built from Harrell (Regression Modeling Strategies), Kuhn & Johnson (Applied Predictive Modeling), ISLP, ESL, van Buuren (FIMD), Molnar (Interpretable ML), Kuhn & Johnson (Feature Engineering and Selection), and TRIPOD+AI. Use when building or reviewing any clinical prediction, prognostic, or association model, especially in stroke research."

# Clinical Prediction Modeling

Methodology distilled from the canonical sources, with runnable Python templates that enforce the methods. Every analysis emits a **decision trace** — a structured log of choices, thresholds, and rationale — so statistical decisions are auditable at publication time.

**Language policy: Python only.** All code generated under this skill is Python (numpy/pandas/scikit-learn/statsmodels/lifelines ecosystem). R packages (e.g., `rms`, `mice`) may be cited in prose as the canonical reference implementation, but never generate R code.

## Core Frameworks

**1. The full-pipeline bootstrap (Harrell).** Any performance estimate that ignores model-building steps is optimistic. Resample patients with replacement, refit the *entire* pipeline (imputation → feature selection → spline fitting → model) inside every resample, evaluate on the out-of-bag patients. Never impute once on the full dataset before resampling. → ch11, templates/validation.py

**2. Imputation is part of the model (van Buuren, Harrell).** Missing data handled by multiple imputation by chained equations (MICE). For prediction: impute inside every resample, apply the training imputation to out-of-bag patients. For inference: m≥20 imputed datasets with posterior draws, pool by Rubin's rules. Complete-case analysis is a bias decision, not a default — report who is excluded and how they differ. → ch03, templates/imputation.py

**3. Continuous predictors get splines by default (Harrell).** Linearity is an assumption to be tested, not imposed. Restricted cubic splines (4–5 knots; 4 df default) for predictors with enough support; keep a linear fallback when the spline is indistinguishable (report the LR test). → ch06, templates/splines.py

**4. Discrimination ≠ calibration ≠ utility.** Report all three: AUC (with percentile CIs from the same bootstrap), calibration slope/intercept and Brier score, and decision-curve analysis for net benefit at plausible thresholds. A model can rank well and still mislead at the bedside. → ch12, templates/metrics.py

**5. Penalize before you select (Harrell, ESL).** In small-n/high-p settings, shrinkage (ridge, lasso, elastic net) beats stepwise selection, which is biased and unstable. If using ML (boosting, RF), tune hyperparameters inside CV folds and compare against a penalized regression baseline on the same folds with paired tests. → ch10, ch13, templates/ml_benchmark.py

**6. Feature selection happens inside folds. Any threshold, filter, or top-N rule computed on the full dataset leaks. → ch13**

**7. Every decision is logged.** Each template call appends to a JSON decision trace: the choice, the alternatives considered, the rationale, the software versions. The trace is the audit trail for the TRIPOD+AI checklist. → ch15, templates/decision_trace.py

**8. Association ≠ prediction ≠ causation.** State which question is being asked. Adjusted ORs from an inferential model answer association; out-of-bag AUC answers prediction; neither answers causation. → ch01

**9. Advisory AI proposes; humans decide.** The Jev method advisor (templates/method_advisor.py) returns calibrated, typed proposals for design choices from analysis metadata only. Proposals are logged in the decision trace with their probability and the human's final decision — never applied autonomously, never a substitute for computed statistics. → ch15, templates/method_advisor.py

## Voice Calibration

Write like the sources: prescriptive, mechanism-first, honest about uncertainty. "Use X when Y" — never "it is worth noting that". Report the estimate, the interval, and what would change the conclusion. Flag discovery-only results as discovery-only.
